Navigate to the simulation directory and use

`./setup.sh`

Which should set up the virtual environment and the require Python packages. Then use the `config_example.json` file to make your own `config.json` file, or just copy it. Make sure you put your local locations for Libero and the LuSEE directory.

Run like:

`python3 simulate_plot.py config.json`
